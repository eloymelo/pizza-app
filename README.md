# Pizzeria - Command-Line Application

This project is a command-line application built with Python. It serves as the initial proof of concept and foundational logic for the full Pizzeria web application. The primary purpose of this repository is to practice and demonstrate core Python programming concepts.

## Project Ecosystem

This is one of three related repositories for the Pizzeria project:
* **pizzeria-cli (This one):** The foundational Python logic in a command-line interface.
* **[pizzeria-database](https://github.com/eloymelo/pizzeria-database):** The SQL scripts for designing the database schema.
* **[pizzeria-webapp](https://github.com/eloymelo/pizzeria-webapp):** The final web application built with Django.

## Data Storage

This command-line version uses a simple `json` file for data persistence. It does **not** use or connect to the SQL database defined in the `pizzeria-database` repository.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* JSON
